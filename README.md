Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods. However, books, food, and medical
products are exempt from sales tax.

Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.

When you purchase items you receive a receipt, which lists the name of all the items and their
price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales
taxes paid.

The sales tax is rounded up to the nearest 0.05 amounts.
